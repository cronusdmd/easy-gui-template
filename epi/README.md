# Egui app Programming Interface

Backend-agnostic interface for writing apps using Egui.

Egui is a GUI library, which can be plugged in to e.g. a game engine.

This crate provides a common interface for programming an app, using Egui, so you can then easily plug it in to a backend such as `egui_web` or `egui_glium`.
