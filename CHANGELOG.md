# Egui Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## Unreleased

### Fixed üêõ

* Fixed bug where a lost widget could still retain keyboard focus.

## 0.3.0 - 2020-11-07

### Added ‚≠ê

* Panels: you can now create panels using `SidePanel`, `TopPanel` and `CentralPanel`.
* You can now override the default Egui fonts.
* Add ability to override text color with `visuals.override_text_color`.
* The demo now includes a simple drag-and-drop example.
* The demo app now has a slider to scale all of Egui.

### Changed üîß

* `ui.horizontal(...)` etc returns `Response`.
* Refactored the interface for `egui::app::App`.
* Windows are now constrained to the screen.
* `Context::begin_frame()` no longer returns a `Ui`. Instead put your widgets into a `SidePanel`, `TopPanel`, `CentralPanel`, `Window` or `Area`.
* `Context::end_frame()` now returns paint commands that need to be converted to triangles with `Context::tesselate()`.
* Anti-aliasing is now off by default in debug builds.

### Removed üî•
