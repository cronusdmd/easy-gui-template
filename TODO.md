# Infrastructure
We need to make it easy to make your own library using emigui_wasm.
Maybe we can use build.rs to generate needed stuff, e.g. index.hmtl?

# Code
* Try it on iPhone
* Read TTF from browser?
* requestAnimationFrame

# Additional bindings, e.g. Piston

# Widgets
* Scroll bar
* Menu bar
* Windows
* Text input
* Color picker
